The above implementation is not recommended for copying, since all solutions within the course at UNN are checked for copy-paste. 
I gave my implementation so that people could understand or see an example of the implementation of various algorithms. 
I apologize in advance for the inconvenience in reading and understanding the code, you can always ask me by emailing me.
